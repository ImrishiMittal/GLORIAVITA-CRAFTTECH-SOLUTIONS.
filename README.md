## Portfolio Website

I’m excited to share my newly completed portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills and experience as a Front-End Developer. This project was an opportunity to implement advanced web development techniques and demonstrate my expertise in creating visually engaging and user-friendly websites.

### Key Features:

- **Responsive Design:** The website is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices, from desktops to mobile phones. The layout adapts to different screen sizes, maintaining usability and aesthetics.
  
- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle:** A modern feature that allows users to switch between light and dark themes. This enhances user experience by providing an option that suits their preference or ambient lighting conditions.
  
- **Smooth Animations:** I’ve integrated smooth transitions and animations to make the user experience more dynamic and engaging. These animations add a touch of interactivity and make the website feel more alive.
  
- **Project Showcases:** The portfolio highlights various projects I've worked on, complete with descriptions, technologies used, and links to live sites or repositories. This section is designed to give visitors a comprehensive view of my work and capabilities.

- **Interactive Icons:** The contact section includes interactive icons linked to my email, GitHub, LinkedIn, and more, making it easy for visitors to connect with me.

### Technologies Used:

- **HTML/CSS:** For structuring and styling the content.
- **JavaScript:** To add interactive elements and smooth animations.
- **Font Awesome:** For elegant and scalable icons.

This project reflects my commitment to continuous learning and improvement in web development. I’m excited to continue exploring new technologies and techniques to further enhance my skills.
